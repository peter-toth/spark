Place files which are being used as resources of tests but shouldn't be added to classpath.

The hive-test-udfs.jar file is used by HiveUDFDynamicLoadSuite.

This file, originally added in SPARK-31312, has become incompatible with Cloudera's
downstream Hive. We needed a way to rebuild the jar based on the original commit
https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/hive/commit/12f3f036b6efd0299cd1d457c0c0a65e0fd7e5f2
but with some Cloudera-specfic changes.

The jar file can be rebuilt by running mvn package in the hive-test-udfs/ directory. The
hive-test-udfs.jar file can be overwritten with the one from the target/ directory.
